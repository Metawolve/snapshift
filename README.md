# SnapShift

A powerful and efficient software solution designed to capture and compare system snapshots. Effortlessly detect and analyze changes in your system's registry and filesystem between snapshots, streamlining your automation tasks.

## Planned Features

- Capture and compare snapshots of the Windows registry and the filesystem
- View the changes, that were made on the system between the two snapshots, in an organized way
- Configure, which parts of the registry and filesystem should be included (or excluded)
- Exclude common registry keys and folders by default, that are changed by the operating system regulary, so the compare results only include the manual changes made
- (Optional) Export the results into a powershell file
